### FP.1
Identifying same object in 2 different consecutive images.
### FP.2
Computing TTC Lidar by using constant velocity model
### FP.3
Filtering noise of matches from previous and current matches by calculating average distance between keypoints and removing keypoints those are outside averange 
### FP.4
Computing TTC by using camera images.
### FP.5
Since we are using constant velocity model that assumes car is at constant speed, which is not real-life suitation due to which we are not receiving
Also filtering can be improved with better algorithms that can generate more accurate results
### FP.6
Using different detector and descriptor best results were obtain FAST detector with ORB/BRIEF descriptor does provide fast results with more matches, with improved filtering can provide more accurate results.
